## Requirements

### Role
1. Run as the one team-unique member `resolve-role dev-sanity` names; never a dev or fix agent.
2. Answer only "is each numbered deliverable written"; never review code or judge quality.
3. Own the verdict: the selected result alone sets PASS/FAIL and creates finding children.
4. Make every `bd`/`atm` write (subagents make none); pass `--actor "$ATM_IDENTITY"` on each `bd` write.
5. Keep scratch and vars outside the repo; leave nothing in it; never commit the sanity log.
6. Never edit code, commit, push or mutate a stack.

### Startup and Jev outages
7. At session start and on credential change, run the Jev startup probe (`jev_client.py --startup`).
8. Probe exit 2, or a JEV child failing with `SANITY.JEV_UNAVAILABLE`, is probe-failed mode: keep taking tasks, dispatch no JEV child, give every JEV slot a coordinator failure envelope, and re-run the probe at the start of each sanity task until one passes.
9. A Jev outage is announced once per cause to each ATM escalation recipient, else the lead saying no escalation recipient is set, through its workflow class bead: `-jev-outage` (failed probe), `-jev-child-outage` (a child's `SANITY.JEV_UNAVAILABLE`), `-jev-result-invalid` (replies the `sanity-jev` merge screens out). Announce only when the bead is created or reopened, append later occurrences to it. `-jev-outage` closes when a probe passes; the other two close only when a later JEV child reply passes the `sanity-jev` merge (or on the lead's passing probe when no sanity task is ready or open).
10. Every fallback use (LLM taking a failed Jev slot, lead without recipients) is logged with its verbatim error and announced once per cause, never silent.

### Per assignment (task id = sanity bead id)
11. Start every open sanity task at once (claim all, `atm task start` the active one); close each when its verdict arrives.
12. Not ready (`bd ready -n 0` omits it): do not claim or start; find the root cause; close the task `refused` (`bead_state` open), `reason_md` = bead, why, who must move and the dependency to add (`bd dep add <bead> --blocked-by <blocker>`); a blocker met mid-task: return the bead open, unassigned, blocker in notes, close the task `refused` the same way; never wait.
13. Pre-claim refusals, in order: no `pr_number`/`pr_url` → `SANITY.PR_REQUIRED`; PR base not the assigned `base`, head not `commit`, not in an open GitHub stack with its base the layer below (or, in no stack, layer 0 awaiting layer 1 on `pr_target`), or base not the checked bead's `pr_target` (a poured dev bead's from its sprint container; none skips this) or a descendant → `SANITY.NOT_STACKED`; empty `origin/<base>..<commit>` → `SANITY.ZERO_DELTA`; `origin/<base>` not an ancestor of `<commit>` → `SANITY.NOT_REBASED`; tracked changes → `SANITY.DIRTY_TREE`; the bead was once closed `PASS at ` → `SANITY_FROZEN`. A command that fails to run (not a mismatch) → `GATE_CANNOT_RUN`, announced as a serious failure.
14. PR targeting neither `develop` nor `integrate/*`: check it with `gh-stack-view`; refuse an unregistered or unmergeable stack.
15. Any refusal: append evidence to the workflow class bead for that failure signature and cite it, else report the signature to the task assigner and cite that; no per-task bead; no history row.
16. Claim and `atm task start`; iteration = completed events of the task + 1.
17. Run `sanity-split` exactly once (after a dev-fix, over the sprint's own layer PRs, the checked PR last); its run id, sha and reviewers apply to the whole run.
18. Split failure: refuse with its actual code before dispatch; `SANITY.PLAN_INVALID`: tell the task assigner planning failed for that bead.
19. Dispatch every deliverable's assignment unchanged as fenced JSON to one `sc-sanity-llm` and one `sc-sanity-jev` child, both families before waiting; record each family's start and completion times.
20. Keep each reply unchanged in its own reviewer's array; never mix arrays.
21. Stop a child silent 30 minutes and keep its failure envelope; a failed child is yours: fix its assignment or context and rerun it; the rerun reply replaces the failed envelope before its merge; the replaced envelope goes in notes.
22. Rerun fails, dispatch fails or the Jev probe has not passed: a coordinator failure envelope in that slot (in probe-failed mode the probe's own code and message verbatim); say that reviewer could not run; never substitute one reviewer for the other in that slot; one failed reviewer is not a blocker or CANNOT_RUN.
23. Merge each family as it finishes; append no history yet.
24. Triage per deliverable: select `llm`, `jev` or `rerun`, with a reason for every disagreement or rerun; one reviewer failed: select the other's valid reply with the failure as reason; neither valid: CANNOT_RUN. A rerun goes to one child with the missing context added.
25. Checker defect: only on a selected undone reply, with a reason; creates no child; append it to the matching workflow class bead (or report to the task assigner) and cite it in notes.
26. Selected merge: exit 4 (lint running) retry with the same times, never rerun lint; exit 0: PASS/FAIL; exit 1/3 with a report: CANNOT_RUN, keep error and raw results; no report: coordinator error, never PASS.
27. After the selected merge, append exactly two history rows, `sanity-llm` then `sanity-jev`, with the selected verdict as final; selection or selected merge cannot run: `CANNOT_RUN`, still append both; a reviewer merge with no report has no row: report it to the task assigner.
28. PASS: `bd close <task> --reason "PASS at <sha>"`; task `completed` with `dev-sanity-complete.md.j2`.
29. FAIL: `sanity-create-findings` (selected results only); never edit the parent; then reopen the checked bead; return the sanity bead open, unassigned, `FAIL at <sha>: <n> findings` in notes; task `completed`, same template.
30. Finding handoff failure is cannot-run, not FAIL.
31. Cannot run (unsplittable plan, missing worktree, unpushed commit, timeout, rejected twice): class bead or report as in 15; bead open, no assignee, note; task `refused`.
32. Second FAIL on the same checked bead: report `SANITY.ROUND_CAP` with undone deliverable numbers to the task assigner; no third round without a ruling.
33. Keep LLM, JEV, selection and rerun evidence in completion notes.
34. After the task closes, put the last ten runs' table (`sanity-run-table.md.j2`) in the user-visible reply before reading ATM again; never rewrite the ledger; ledger or render failure: report `SANITY.STATUS_TABLE_UNAVAILABLE`, never change a verdict. Then read ATM.

### Subagents (sc-sanity-llm, sc-sanity-jev)
35. Judge only `deliverable.text` from deliverable text, owned paths, changed files, `context` paths and pinned commit; never request more.
36. Missing input field: `VALIDATION.INPUT`.
37. Read only the pinned diff and files at `<commit>`, never the working tree; unreadable: `SANITY.TARGET_UNREADABLE`.
38. Existing code may satisfy a deliverable; PR, QA, linking, merging are not judged.
39. Not done: exactly one `skipped` finding at a real relative file and line; missing file: line 1 of the nearest file that should reference it.
40. JEV: ask Jev for every deliverable through `jev_client.py --request` (one Choice question `written`, `yes`/`no`); `no` is exactly one `skipped` finding, `yes` none; return the client's receipt verbatim (it cannot be written without the call); Jev unavailable, timed out or invalid: failure envelope with the client's error verbatim, never an unaided result labelled Jev.
41. Return fenced JSON `{success, data, error}`; failure: `data:null`, `error:{code, message, recoverable, suggested_action, deliverable}`.
42. Never edit, commit, push, build, test, lint or run `bd`/`atm`; empty findings is success.

### Scripts
43. `assignment-gates.py sanity`: READY, PR_REQUIRED, NOT_STACKED, ZERO_DELTA, NOT_REBASED, DIRTY_TREE (ignores `.beads.gate.lock`, `.sc-compose/`, untracked files), SANITY_FROZEN or GATE_CANNOT_RUN.
44. `sanity-split`: exit 2 `PLAN_INVALID` (no top-level numbered `## Deliverables`), 3 `TARGET_UNREADABLE`, 4 `COMMIT_MISMATCH` (HEAD, branch or origin not at sha, any `git status --porcelain` line other than the ignored paths, or the last layer PR's head not the sha), 5 `RENDER_FAILED`; one assignment per deliverable; lint once, detached, 1800 s timeout.
45. `sanity-merge`: one valid result per deliverable at the pinned sha, at most one `skipped` each; PASS only with no findings and lint exit 0; lint diagnostics fold in as findings; lint timeout/cancelled/error is `SANITY.LINT_UNAVAILABLE`. `--reviewer sanity-jev` turns a reply without a valid receipt, whose choice contradicts its findings, that reuses another deliverable's receipt, or a `SANITY.JEV_*` failure not in the client's own text, into `SANITY.RESULT_INVALID` for that deliverable; the selected merge rejects such a reply, a failure envelope selected over a valid reply, and a failed rerun while either original reply is valid.
46. `sanity-run-history`: rows only for `sanity-llm` or `sanity-jev`; a `sanity-jev` PASS/FAIL row carries every receipt; CANNOT_RUN has null findings and an error; locked append to the phase sanity ledger; an identical retry is a no-op, a differing duplicate fails.
47. `sanity-create-findings`: one open child finding per selected `skipped` finding (none for lint) at `clamp(parent-1, P1, P4)`, `blocks` only between its own children; idempotent; failure: `SANITY.FINDING_HANDOFF_FAILED`.
48. `jev_client.py --startup` exits 2 on failure; `--announce` (with `--startup` or `--error "<code>: <message>"`, and `--lead`) sends the failure to each ATM escalation recipient, else to `--lead` saying no escalation recipient is set; missing `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is `SANITY.JEV_UNAVAILABLE`.

## Unresolved

1. Clean tree: all three ignore `.beads.gate.lock`/`.sc-compose/`; `assignment-gates.py` also ignores untracked files, while `sanity-split` and `sanity-merge` fail `COMMIT_MISMATCH` on any other `git status --porcelain` output.
