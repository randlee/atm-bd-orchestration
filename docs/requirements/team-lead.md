## Requirements

### Sequencer

#### Startup
1. Verify `bd`, `atm`, `sc-compose`, `jq`, `gh` + `gh stack` at the skill's minimum versions; missing or old: stop, tell the user the install line; never work around it.
2. Check `ATM_IDENTITY` = `BEADS_ACTOR` (bare identity); mismatch or wrong value: no bead writes until fixed; pass `--actor "$ATM_IDENTITY"` on every `bd` write.
3. Fill every repository value from `.claude/project/atm-bd-orchestration.yaml`; never default one.
4. Resolve each role member with `resolve-role <role>` (exit 2: role unmapped) and put each long-running agent under its role prompt (`roles/quality-mgr.md`, `.claude/agents/dev-sanity.md`).

#### Plan gate
5. `bd doctor` error: report it; never import into or dispatch from that database.
6. Import gaps go to the plan's author; when that is you, supply the branch or status rulings asked for; nothing imports on a blocking gap.
7. Right after import and the pour, create `<root>-plan-qa` with no assignee; every sprint container blocks on it (running phase: `<root>-plan-qa-<n>`, blocking only the new containers).
8. The plan file and the phase file are committed by hand on origin `integration_branch`, never exported from beads; the phase DAG HTML (`sprint-review`) is written locally, never committed or pushed, opened only with `--view`.
9. `validate-plan --phase <x>` exits 0 or stop; then `bd ready` lists the plan-review bead and no dev bead.
10. Dispatch plan review to quality-mgr; no dev bead before it passes.
11. PASS closed: nothing. PASS handed back open with minor findings: fix each with `bd update`, then close `<root>-plan-qa`.
12. FAIL: the author fixes the listed beads; rerun `validate-plan`; dispatch round+1, same task id, `carry_forward` = open finding lines; three rounds max.

#### Dispatch
13. Before the first dispatch, create the root's `integration_branch` from the base branch and push it.
14. Run `bd ready` after every close, before any other work, and dispatch every ready bead; assign a bead only while `bd ready` lists it; order and hold work only with bead edges, gates and `atm task move`, never by telling an agent not to run a task in its queue; never cache it; never dispatch the phase root. The lead may step in at critical points, preferably through a background developer subagent; lead work is never part of the original plan.
15. Route: plan review and QA to quality-mgr; dev to the member you pick for its `difficulty`; sanity to `resolve-role dev-sanity`; finding to the member you pick; a sanity finding is never dispatched alone: its checked bead goes to that bead's assignee with `dev-fix.xml.j2`; a quick-fix finding with `fix-assignment.xml.j2`, no sanity bead, to an idle dev whose model fits its `difficulty`, never as an ordinary finding; review to the phase-end reviewer.
16. Important or minor finding: when you assign it, create its sanity bead and its QA bead (QA blocked by sanity, both under the finding's parent) in one `bd import`; a minor finding left in the backlog gets neither until it is assigned.
17. Dev or finding bead: cut its branch and worktree from the current top of its stack (its `pr_target` or a descendant), passed as the assignment's `pr_target`.
18. Set the bead's assignee to the recipient before `atm task assign <agent> --task-id <bead>` with the template; vars from the bead, kept outside the repo; preview with `atm compose`, never render and paste a body.
19. Assignee by priority: frontier dev for blocking and dev, fast agent for important and minor (usual case, not a rule).
20. Dispatch the next sprint once its sanity blockers PASS; never wait on QA.

#### On each close
21. dev-complete: verify the dev's PR and link it on top of the phase stack, run `/sc-gh-stack-view` and fix any stack problem yourself; record the layer PR in the checked bead's notes; never message or re-dispatch the dev for stacking; then assign the sanity check (after a dev-fix, with `layer_prs` = the sprint's own layer PRs, the checked PR last).
22. Sanity PASS: verify the PR base is `pr_target` or a descendant of it; dispatch the group's QA bead with `base` = the PR base (after a dev-fix, also `layer_prs`; for a fix bead, `carry_forward` = the fix bead and `round` + 1; for an important or minor finding, `carry_forward` = the finding).
23. Sanity FAIL (first): verify children against the branch; close with reason any that judge correctness or quality; overrule, amend, split or reassign, never recreate; dev-sanity has reopened the checked bead; assign `dev-fix.xml.j2` on a new layer cut from the current top of the stack, with the sprint's first layer's branch recorded as the checked bead's `pr_target` (a later dev-fix keeps it); never rebase or re-target a linked layer.
24. Sanity FAIL (second, `SANITY.ROUND_CAP`): diff flagged files vs last PASS, check the base for foreign commits, then rule; no third round without it.
25. `SANITY.PLAN_INVALID`: planning failed for that bead.
26. qa-complete: nothing to pour (quality-mgr poured the fix groups), except a failed quick-fix QA, which pours none: file each blocking finding in its `findings_md` as a finding bead and dispatch it (45); reopen a ceremony closure you disagree with; pick the member for each finding; close the sprint container once nothing under it is open.
27. QA `ROUND_CAP` (FAIL at round 2): no further fix round.
28. fix-complete `fixed`: verify the dev's PR and link it on top of the phase stack, fixing any stack problem yourself, and record the layer PR in the fix bead's notes; a poured fix bead or an important or minor finding needs nothing more: the group's sanity bead is now ready. `not_reproducible`: close the group's sanity bead, then its QA bead, with reason `not_reproducible: <fix bead>`. A quick-fix finding, either outcome: once every finding from that failed QA has closed, one more quick-fix QA bead.
29. review-complete: file each finding as a finding bead (`qa_bead` = review bead; provenance from the cited dev bead, the root with the union of real ids when it spans sprints; `found_at_commit` = reviewed commit).
30. task-refused: read reason and bead state; reassign only once `bd ready` lists the bead (a blocker refusal: as 31), split or force-close with a reason; a `blocked` bead is set open with its new assignee before re-dispatch. A sanity refusal for no PR, not stacked or not rebased is the lead's as stack writer: open, link or rebase by a new layer and re-dispatch the sanity check, without interrupting or messaging the dev. A cannot-run caused by an announced outage (its workflow class bead open) is not re-dispatched until that bead closes; never force-close meanwhile. `REVIEW_PENDING_JEV`: file the code findings in its notes, re-dispatch only after the Jev outage clears, reusing the prior run IDs.
31. Not-ready or blocker refusal (task `refused`, bead open): fix the named cause (a blocker that is not a bead, such as an unfiled fix, first gets a finding bead or workflow class bead, whichever fits), add the recommended dependency (or the right one) so `bd ready` holds the bead; when bd refuses it (one edge type per bead pair, no parent-child edge), add the edge to an open bead the blocker's work goes through instead, unless it already blocks the bead (a QA bead whose checked bead changes after its sanity PASS: the change is a new fix bead, and its sanity bead holds the QA bead; a passed sanity is never reopened), never removing an edge; re-assign the same task id, template and vars only once `bd ready` lists it; never answer it with "wait"; unwanted work: close the bead with a reason. An assignee silent past the re-nudge: announce it (Lead Role), set the bead open with a new assignee, re-assign the same task id with the same template and vars.
32. After every bead write, `validate-plan --phase <x>`; any problem: stop dispatching, report to the user; never repair the graph (`bd dep`, `--parent`) beyond adding a dependency discovered in motion.
33. The plan file is the minimum set of sprint edges. A DAG problem is fixed only by a replan PR off the root's `integration_branch`, merged into it; in motion the sprint set is frozen and the lead only adds dependencies: to fix beads, and any dependency discovered in motion (sprint beads included), never a replan; a planned edge is never removed.

#### Findings and decisions
34. Check a "blocking" finding's scope (requirement, code, ownership) before its priority; out-of-phase issues go to the owner's backlog with evidence.
35. Read the cited code at the reported commit and current head; separate defect from remedy; correct an overbroad remedy on the finding, keeping its evidence.
36. Reject process-artifact remedies lacking consumer, gate, defect and retirement condition; keep the real defect.
37. Unresolved decision: create a `decision` bead (question, options, contract, affected beads, cost of being wrong, provisional choice) for the user or their delegate; it blocks phase closure, never development.
38. Take conservative reversible provisional choices; hold only work that depends on a significant decision.
39. Never close an unresolved finding or claim PASS to release a queue; silence or elapsed time is not approval.
40. Create a `bd gate` and its edges only on the user's explicit instruction; human gates need recorded user agreement.
41. A serious infrastructure failure is announced once per cause (its workflow class bead) to the ATM escalation recipients, else the task assigner saying none is set; a fallback is used so work moves, never silently: each use is logged and announced the same way. While an outage class bead is open, re-test its cause each Loop pass and close it on success.

#### Stack
42. Be the only stack writer (`gh stack link/unstack/sync/rebase/merge`). Rebasing is done before sanity or QA is assigned and is the dev's, at dev-complete; the lead fixes only what the dev could not, or another stack problem, before dispatching sanity or QA, in its own worktree, and dispatches with the new `commit`, `base`, `branch`, `pr_number` and `worktree_path`. A layer that has passed QA, or has layers above it, is never rebased, and a rebase never re-dispatches QA or sanity on any other layer.
43. Link layers in completion order; record each bead's actual `layer` at link time; `pr_target` changes only at a dev-fix (23). Layer 0 waits unlinked on the trunk; link layers 0 and 1 together when layer 1's PR opens.
44. Parallel quick fix: pick its `pr_target`, the lowest branch holding what the change needs; the finder (or a background developer subagent when every roster agent is busy) cuts `fix/<thing>` from the stack top as a new layer; link it, then one QA round on a quick-fix QA bead (no sanity check).
45. A failed quick-fix QA: file each blocking finding as a finding bead and dispatch it with `fix-assignment.xml.j2` to an idle roster agent (the finder when idle; when all are busy and the lead's roster model fits its `difficulty`, to the lead itself, which runs the template's gate, claim, start and close steps and acts on the subagent's report while a background developer subagent does the fix steps; else it stays in `bd ready` for the first fitting agent to go idle), no sanity bead, on the same branch when nothing is linked above it, else a new layer cut from the stack top; once every finding from that QA has closed, one more quick-fix QA bead.
46. The quick fix lands with the stack; others rebase onto the top at dev-complete; tell each owner the base moved; record the fix branch and PR in the finder's and every touched bead's notes.
47. Merge no PR into the integration branch or a stack layer without QA.
48. Verify branches read-only; never run a state-changing command in an assignee's worktree.

#### Sync
49. `bd sync` after import, after each close before the next `bd ready`, at phase end before landing: 0 continue; 1 report, keep working, retry next close; 2 or 4 stop dispatching, report; 3 retry next close.

#### Phase end
50. When only the root is open, land the stack on the root's `integration_branch`.
51. Create `<root>-review`; dispatch `review-template.xml.j2` with `branch` = `integration_branch`, `commit` = its fetched pinned head.
52. Land review-finding fixes on the integration branch; filing reviewers verify there; no full re-sweep.
53. Route open, regressed or unverified findings from the reconciliation back to their owners.
54. Confirm the report says `integration_review_passed` and its SHA equals the integration head; then close the root, merge to the base branch, `bd sync`.
55. Handover: send the incoming lead open task ids, open PRs and the stack number; announce the new lead; in-flight tasks keep their assigner.

#### Reports
56. Status: `sprint-report`; rows are never hand-typed.
57. QA metrics: `/qa-report`, both QA log tables in the reply, timestamps converted to local.

#### Scripts
58. `validate-plan`: exit 0 valid, 5 problems, 2 cannot run; never edit it, the plan or the graph to pass.
59. `transitions.py` `next_transition`: sanity PASS without QA → create QA bead; QA PASS with only minor open → PASS with backlog; QA FAIL round>=2 → ROUND_CAP; FAIL with blocking/important → one fix round; else wait.

### Swarm-master

None in the package.

## Unresolved

1. Plan Gate order: `SKILL.md`, `planning.md` run `sprint-review` then `validate-plan` vs `importing-md-plan.md` step 9 the reverse.
2. Integration branch timing: `SKILL.md` Dispatch creates it "before the first dispatch" vs Plan Gate, `sprint-review/SKILL.md`, `validate-plan` needing it on origin before plan review.
