# Role: dev-sanity (atm-bd-orchestration)

The dev-sanity role runs the sanity check of every closed dev or fix bead in
a phase run with atm-bd-orchestration. It is long-running; this role applies
to every task it receives until the lead switches it back.

A sanity check asks one question of a closed dev or fix bead: is each numbered
deliverable written? It is not QA: requirements and quality belong to QA. Lint
is a separate mechanical gate. The checker receives only deliverable text,
owned paths, changed files, and a pinned commit; that evidence must let a
luna-class agent answer `written: yes/no, file:line` correctly.

## Who Fills It

The skill names the role, never a member or an agent. The repository
decides both:

| Setting | Where | {{ repo_name }} |
| --- | --- | --- |
| member | `roles.dev-sanity` in `.claude/agents/registry.yaml`; print it with `.claude/skills/atm-beads/scripts/resolve-role dev-sanity` | `{{ dev_sanity_member }}` |
| directive | that member's `[startup.<member>]` prompt in `.atm.toml` | `.claude/agents/dev-sanity-llm.md` |

The member name is unique to the team, because Herdr agent names are global
on the host. It is never a dev or fix agent, which would make sanity checks
wait behind their work. Switching how checks run (an LLM check, a jev check)
changes the directive in `.atm.toml`, not this skill.

## Tasks

Every task is a sanity check bead rendered from `dev-sanity-template.xml.j2`,
and the task id is the bead id. The template carries the task values and the
bead and task lifecycle; the member's agent prompt (its directive) says how
the check runs.

Sanity checks gate dependent dev work, so speed matters: the member starts
every open sanity check task at once, each with its own team of check
subagents, and closes them in whatever order their verdicts arrive. Nothing
waits on another check.

## Check Contract

## Pre-claim refusals

Before claim, the sanity member performs these numbered checks at the pinned
commit. Each failure is a refusal, not a best-effort check:

1. `test -n "$PR_NUMBER" && test -n "$PR_URL"`; otherwise refuse
   `SANITY.PR_REQUIRED`.
2. `gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json baseRefName,headRefOid --jq '.baseRefName + " " + .headRefOid'`
   must equal the declared `pr_target` and commit; otherwise refuse
   `SANITY.STALE_BASE`. Then `git fetch origin`.
3. `git log --format=%H "origin/$PR_TARGET..$COMMIT" | grep -q .` must pass;
   otherwise refuse `SANITY.ZERO_DELTA`.
4. `test -z "$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no | grep -v '^?? \.beads\.gate\.lock$')"`
   must pass; otherwise refuse `SANITY.DIRTY_TREE`.
5. `bd history "$TASK_ID"` must contain no earlier PASS; otherwise refuse
   `SANITY_FROZEN`.

For every refusal, before the refusal message or task close, strictly render
`templates/workflow-issue-bead.json.j2` with id `$TASK_ID-wf-$CODE`, import it
with `bd import <scratch>/$TASK_ID-wf-$CODE.json`, and name that workflow issue
id in the refusal.

One check is one closed bead at one pinned commit, split per deliverable:

- `scripts/sanity-split` reads the bead, parses the numbered list under
  `## Deliverables`, pins the commit, lists the changed files against the
  bead's `owned_paths`, starts the lint command in the background, and
  renders one assignment per deliverable from
  `templates/dev-sanity-assignment.json.j2`.
- The directive sends each assignment to its own check subagent as fenced
  JSON, all at once, and reads one fenced JSON result per deliverable back.
  The subagent owns that contract, in its `## Inputs` and `## Output Format`:
  [`.claude/agents/sc-sanity-llm.md`](../../../agents/sc-sanity-llm.md).
  Every check subagent (`sc-sanity-jev.md` too) keeps the same assignment
  and result, so a repository switches checks by switching the directive in
  `.atm.toml`.
- `scripts/sanity-merge` accepts exactly one result per deliverable at the
  pinned SHA, checks that the worktree is still at that SHA and clean,
  folds in the lint exit code and diagnostics, and writes the verdict and
  the report vars.

The check leaves nothing in the repository: `sanity-split` writes only the
lint log and the lint exit file under `--scratch`, the renderer's transient
input file is deleted once each assignment is rendered, and sc-compose keeps
its own log under `.sc-compose/`, which is gitignored.

There is no fallback. A bead whose `## Deliverables` is not a numbered list
cannot be split; the check is refused with `SANITY.PLAN_INVALID` and the
lead is told that planning failed for that bead. Every deliverable appears
in the report by number, done or with its findings, so closure is explicit.

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Sanity check bead | Task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PASS | `bd close` with reason `PASS at <commit>` | `completed`, `dev-sanity-complete.md.j2` |
| FAIL | stays open: `bd update --status open --append-notes` | `completed`, `dev-sanity-complete.md.j2` with the findings |
| cannot run | stays open, with a note | `refused`, `task-refused.md.j2` |

A FAIL never closes the bead. Closing it would release the dev beads that
depend on the checked sprint. The sanity member creates one child finding bead of
the checked bead per undone deliverable, never one per lint diagnostic. The parent/child
hierarchy is the closure gate; a parent-to-child
`blocks` edge is invalid. Each child is blocking at `clamp(parent priority - 1, P1, P4)`, records
the same structured JSON finding data as the sanity report, and copies the
checked bead's phase/sprint/stack/layer provenance. The lead reviews those
children and may overrule or modify them, but does not recreate their report
data. The lead then follows its existing process to reopen the parent and
assign the dev fix. It adds `blocks` edges only between those new beads, where one fix depends on another. The parent cannot close until all children close. That closure makes the
same sanity check bead ready again.

After the second FAIL for the same checked bead, the sanity member reports
`SANITY.ROUND_CAP` to the lead with the undone deliverable numbers. No third
round is dispatched without the lead's ruling.

## Mandatory Console Report

After every completed PASS or FAIL task close, follow the assignment's step e3:
append to the existing ignored sanity ledger, render the newest ten completed
runs with `templates/sanity-run-table.md.j2`, and include the complete rendered
table as Markdown directly in the user-visible completion reply before reading
ATM again. Preserve the exact `S | PR | Find | ✓ | Done | Iter` columns, order,
and symbols. Tool stdout, a file path, or an ATM task-close body alone is not
the completion report. Refusals do not append or display a completed run. If
append or rendering fails, report `SANITY.STATUS_TABLE_UNAVAILABLE` and the error
in that reply without altering the completed verdict.
